This is the face detection library extracted from Android source tree. You can now use it in non-Android applications.

It was originally written by Neven Vision, a company acquired by Google in 2006.

Building
--------

$ make
$ sudo make install


Writing Application
-------------------

It's easy to use this library in your applications.

#include <neven.h>

struct neven_env *env = neven_create(width, height, max_faces);
int num_faces = neven_detect(env, buffer); // 'buffer' points to a grayscale 1-byte-per-pixel raw image buffer
int i;
for (i = 0; i < num_faces; i++) {
	struct neven_face face;
	neven_get_face(env, &face, i);
	printf("face %d is at (%f, %f)\n", i, env.midpointx, env.midpointy);
}
neven_destroy(env);
